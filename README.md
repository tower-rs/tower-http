More information about this crate can be found in the [crate documentation][docs].

## Middleware

Tower HTTP contains lots of middleware that are generally useful when building
HTTP servers and clients. Some of the highlights are:

- `Trace` adds high level logging of requests and responses. Supports both
  regular HTTP requests as well as gRPC.
- `Compression` and `Decompression` to compress/decompress response bodies.
- `FollowRedirect` to automatically follow redirection responses.

See the [docs] for the complete list of middleware.

Middleware uses the [http] crate as the HTTP interface so they're compatible
with any library or framework that also uses [http]. For example [hyper].

The middleware were originally extracted from one of [@EmbarkStudios] internal
projects.

## Examples

The [examples] folder contains various examples of how to use Tower HTTP:

- [warp-key-value-store]: A key/value store with an HTTP API built with warp.
- [tonic-key-value-store]: A key/value store with a gRPC API and client built with tonic.
- [axum-key-value-store]: A key/value store with an HTTP API built with axum.

## Minimum supported Rust version

tower-http's MSRV is 1.60.
